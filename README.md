# Rooster Teeth API - Unofficial

![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/samcooke98/rt-api.svg?branch=master) 

Hi There! I (ages ago) did a bit of packet inspection to discover the API endpoints for roosterteeth.com. This was done by proxying requests from the mobile iOS app through my computer. 

It's fairly basic, and I don't know how much more work I will put into it. 


## Todo
See the issues. Documentation is high on my list right now. 


## Pull Requests
If you feel the need to contribute, cool! I've written some (incredibly) basic tests so far, so it would be great if you could follow suit and write tests as well. 

If you end up using this somewhere, please let me know!
